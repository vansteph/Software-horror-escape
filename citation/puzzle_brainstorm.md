## Learning goal of the puzzle:
- How to cite code of others? -> connection to license puzzle?
    - probably difficult as the code you want to reuse may not have a CFF file..
- How to make your own code citeable?
    - that's where you have more control!
- introducing CFF format? That makes it different from the pushing to Zenodo puzzle
- learn about authorship: who should be cited -> correct metadata in your citation!
- redirect citations to another paper? to bundle citations?

## Black cat shenanigans:
- Put everyone that has the slightest connection to you in alphabetical order (when your last name starts with a Z.. or van ...)
- Put your supervisor first
- Cite black cat et al., after the black cat correct a type in your readme

## Problems with this puzzle:
- how does a CFF help you in the situation where you have to publish your manuscript before midnight? its more about helping others to cite your code? so more important in the long run?
- its good software practice, but maybe not that urgent compared to have a DOI (on Zenodo).


## Best software practice solution:
- CFF without Zenodo (to guarantee that the puzzles can be played independently):
    - use a CFF file that has standard metadata for citations, that can be integrated on your GitHub
    - help others to cite your code correctly
    - 

- otherwise use the Zenodo generate CFF file buttons..

## Puzzle Ideas:
- quiz around authorship for software, who deserves to be cited in what order?
