## Learning goal of the puzzle:
- How to push from GitHub to Zenodo
- making people aware that you can easily archive
- GitHub not permanent -> not citeable

## Black cat shenanigans:
- Cat suggests that you store your code on Google Drive and share the URL with the publisher.

## Best software practice solution:
- Choice of GitHub -> puzzle by Meron? That shows how to version control easily
- Zenodo as a better solution regaring sharing an URL bamboozle, permanence in archiving (citation is other puzzle?)

## Puzzle Ideas:
- DOI as the key to sth?
- Too much to ask people to actually push to Zenodo / sandbox
- complete string for DOI? 
- multiple choice of what you get?
- multiple choice (with pictures?): What to submit to the publisher? Like the Zenodo URL - concept DOI - version DOI - link to the zip
