## Learning goal of the puzzle:
- inspired by CodeRefinery?
- FAIR software, documentation helps the reusability
- how to capture the environment, how to make your research reproducible? in context of the reproducibility crisis


## Black cat shenanigans:
- good code does not need to be documented, its self-explanatory.
- having the code and data is enough and everyone can run the same experiment again and will come to the same result. Just by reading the paper and having data and sofware.
- reviewers will not check anyway and will believe whatever you write.

## Problems with this puzzle:
- do publishers review code? 
- requirements and yml files too complicated, also Docker etc too complicated

## Best software practice solution:
- focus on the environment part: a readme with clear instructions on how to set up the environment and how to run the code.
- How to structure a readme, what parts should be present.


## Puzzle Ideas:
- What is missing puzzle?
- Examples of misleading or bad readme, or pick the best readme?
- Correct order of things? Like bring things in the right order so that its a nice readme.
